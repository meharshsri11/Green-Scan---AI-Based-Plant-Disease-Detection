    ### Project Vision
    The mission of Green-Scan is to democratize precision agriculture. We believe that powerful AI tools shouldn't be limited to large-scale operations. By providing a free, simple, and accurate disease detection tool, we aim to empower farmers and gardeners to make timely decisions, reduce crop loss, and promote sustainable farming practices.

    ---

    ### How It Works: The Technology
    Green-Scan is a web application built entirely in Python, using several key technologies:

    * **Streamlit:** For creating the interactive and user-friendly web interface you're using right now.
    * **TensorFlow & Keras:** For building and running the core of our systemâ€”a deep learning model known as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
    * **The Model:** Our CNN was trained on the extensive PlantVillage dataset, which contains over 87,000 images. It has learned to identify the unique visual patterns and textures of 38 different plant diseases and healthy leaves.

    ---

    ### Key Features
    This application has been developed with the user in mind, incorporating features like:

    * **Dual Image Input:** You can either upload a file directly from your device or paste a URL for instant analysis.
    * **Instant Diagnosis:** Get a prediction in seconds, powered by our trained AI model.
    * **Actionable Advice:** For diagnosed diseases, the app provides recommended actions and remedies to help you treat your plants.
    * **Supported Diseases List:** A comprehensive list of all diseases the model can currently identify, so you know what to expect.
